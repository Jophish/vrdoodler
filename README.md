how to draw in 3d online

Virtual reality has been touted as the “next best thing” by many. 
However, many of its products as well as development platforms are proprietary and costly.  
VRDoodler makes this rapidly expanding medium more accessible to everyone because anyone can go to the web page, 
draw/sketch their spatialized ideas, and render them into a virtual reality(3D) space.  
It is also open-sourced, which means anyone can request or even add enhancements.
