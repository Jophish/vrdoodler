how to draw in 3d online

Virtual reality has been touted as the “next best thing” by many. 
However, many of its products as well as development platforms are proprietary and costly.  
VRDoodler makes this rapidly expanding medium more accessible to everyone because anyone can go to the web page, 
draw/sketch their spatialized ideas, and render them into a virtual reality(3D) space.  
I welcome your enhancement requests or inputs

This uses node.js - download the VRDoodler files into a folder, run node server.js in the terminal. Access vrdoodler.html via localhost:8080

(D)raw toggles drawing.  When not drawing, you can rotate the camera, zoom in/out, and decide the angle at which to draw.   Use (S)nap To to attach the new line to previous line or to draw along that same plane; when not drawing, the Snap To orbits the camera round the drawn object.
